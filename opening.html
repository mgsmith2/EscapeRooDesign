<p>Let’s talk about Vincent Van Gogh. This Duch post-impressionist painter became one of the most beloved artists all around the world after his death in 1890.<br> 
  Van Gogh paved the way for modern artists with his unique brushstrokes and color pallet. He was one of the first artists who took their childhood<br> trauma and turned it into something beautiful. All of his paintings told a little big of his story. His official cause of death was ruled<br> 
  out to be suicide, but there are many skeptics out there that believe there’s no way that he would have done something like that.<br>  <br>

It’s up to you to try and figure it out. We will be bringing you back to his old home to look for more clues on what his cause of death really was.
